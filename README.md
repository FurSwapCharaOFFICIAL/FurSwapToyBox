# FurSwap's Toy Box
A mod for Balatro that breaks the balance in the dumbest ways possible.

- This mod is a work of my own that's a passion project of mine, it is built using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). 
- It's made just as a beginner's project and has NO rhyme or reason for any sort of balance because I want it to be FUN!
- This is also intended to be a Cryptid extension similar to how Jen's Almanac is.
